      <p class="card-text">Body-Building is a very well known sport. This type of lifting, is generally only to produce size goals. If you are looking to get bigger and grow a lot of mass than Body-Building is the way to go. It's more of lighter weight training and more isolation movements to grow the muscle rather than strength. Yes, you will get stronger. However, it will be minor.  </p>

      <p class="card-text">Power-Lifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts. The Squat, Bench press, and Deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single-lift effort of a barbell loaded with weight plates.</p>

  <h2>Experience:</h2>
  <br><div> I've been weight-training for 4-5 years of my life. I have done all three forms of lifting. Body-Building, Power-Lifting, and Power-Building. I must say that Power-Building has been by far one of my best forms of training because it is what I have found that was the most effective for me. Now I know what you are thinking. you think you need to just follow someone's workout plan and someone else's diet plan in order to receive the same progress. If that is what you are thinking than you are completely wrong. After my years of training I've come to realize that everyone's body is different, some people's may be similarly put together. But everyone is still different. These three programs are to best support you as it supported me. Once i began Power-Building 3 years ago, i have seen nothing but strength and size gains which is the best of both worlds in my book. It is something that I deeply strive for. And you can too!
