            <p class="card-text"></p>

            <p>During this program, you will be focused on strength and not size. Judging by your one rep max, you will use different percentages and train. Unlike Power-Building, this form of lifting only focuses on strength and little size.</p>
            <p>This is a very well put together Bench Press program. It focuses on mainly the Bench Press and putting on strength in that lift. You can use this same program for the other main lifts as well</p>

            <ul>
                <li>

                    Chest Dips: 4 sets of 10-15 reps (you can even add weight to yourself and do them for more fatigue, adding weight will make it more difficult and make you stronger in the long run);<br>
                    Chest Flies: 3 sets of 10-15 reps, weight of your choice (Better if you choose a heavy but not too heavy weight)<br>

            </ul><br>

            <p>The main lifts and accessories are listed above. As you can see there is mainly a lot of sets on the main lifts. This is something called "Volume." Volume is important when trying to put on strength.</p><br>
            <p>Now comes rest period between sets:<br><br>
                You should go for roughly 3-5 minutes rest between sets, (ONLY ON THE MAIN LIFTS SUCH AS BENCH PRESS, SQUATS and ROWS) everything else go for 45 seconds - 2 minutes between sets.</p>
